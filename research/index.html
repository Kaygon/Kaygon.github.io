                <p class="mt-3">Mechanical metamaterials are architected materials formed from periodically repeated unit cells.
                    In the limit of infinite periodicity, their response can be described by an effective continuum with well-defined bulk properties. 
                    In this research, we investigated Miura-ori-derived metamaterials, and developed a general framework to derive their homogenized properties.
                    We demonstrated a wide range of tunability in directional elastic moduli, which stems from the transformable nature of origami-based structures.
                    The elastic moduli are derived through the theorem of virtual work, which are then validated through finite element simulations.
                    We also derive the conditions of isotropy in 2D planar Miura-ori tessellation and 3D Stacked Miura-ori structures.<br>
                    Details will be disclosed after journal acceptance.<br>

                <p class="mt-3">While looking into the analytical formulations of the stiffness of Miura-ori in the previous research, I discovered a curious phenomenon: 
                    for small sized Miura-ori, the stiffness graph looked like a direc-delta function. Although this was not in the scope of the previous research,
                    I decided to investigate this phenomenon further as a separate research project.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">It is well known that an infinite Miura-ori structure exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio, showing monotonical variation of structural length.
                    However, in a finite Miura-ori structure, the Poisson's ratio transitions from positive to negative. At the point where Poisson's ratio changes its sign, 
                    boundary effects induce a local minimum in effective length and generate a geometry-driven locking along one of the principal axes.</p>

                    The above figures show the compression tests of two different initial configurations of Miura-Ori structures.
                    The left figure starts from the near fully unfolded state, while the right figure starts from a partially folded state.
                    Locking is observed in both cases as the structure approaches its minimum height.
