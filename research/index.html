                <p class="mt-3">Mechanical metamaterials are architected materials formed from periodically repeated unit cells.
                    In the limit of infinite periodicity, their response can be described by an effective continuum with well-defined bulk properties. 
                    In this research, we investigated Miura-ori-derived metamaterials, and developed a general framework to derive their homogenized properties.
                    We demonstrated a wide range of tunability in directional elastic moduli, which stems from the transformable nature of origami-based structures.
                    The elastic moduli are derived through the theorem of virtual work, which are then validated through finite element simulations.
                    We also derive the conditions of isotropy in 2D planar Miura-ori tessellation and 3D Stacked Miura-ori structures.<br>

                    <p class="sidenote-text">While looking into the analytical formulations of the stiffness of Miura-ori in the previous research, I discovered a curious phenomenon: 
                    for small sized Miura-ori, the stiffness graph looked like a direc-delta function. Although this was not in the scope of the previous research,
                    I decided to investigate this phenomenon further as a separate research project.<br></p>
                    <p style="color: red;"><strong>
                    Detailed figures are hidden at the request of co-authors due to ongoing journal submission, but private Zoom meetings are available to discuss results!</strong>

                </div>
                <p class="mt-3">In an infinite Miura-ori sheet, the structure exhibits a negative Poisson’s ratio, leading to a monotonic change in its overall length during deformation.
                    In contrast, a finite Miura-ori structure shows a strikingly different behavior: its effective Poisson’s ratio transitions from positive to negative.
                    At the configuration where this sign change occurs, boundary effects create a local minimum in the global length and induce a geometry-driven locking along one of the principal axes.
                    This locking phenomenon is strongly size-dependent, demonstrating size-dependent programmability in origami metamaterials.
                    We experimentally verified this locking through uniaxial compression tests, as shown below.

                    The above figures show the compression tests of two different initial configurations of Miura-Ori structures.
                    The left figure starts from the near fully unfolded state, while the right figure starts from a partially folded state.
                    Locking is observed in both cases as the structure approaches its minimum height.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">The above locking was due to a local minimum of the effective length along one principal axis, when Poisson's ratio equals zero.
                    Extending the analysis to three dimensions, I found locking along directions in which the Poisson-coupled responses cancel, independent of tessellation size.
                The size-dependent locking emerges as the special case aligned with the principal orthotropic axis.</p>
