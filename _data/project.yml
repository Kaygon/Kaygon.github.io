  #     <p>The course registration process at Seoul National University, often referred to as a "war," is notoriously competitive due to its first-come, first-served nature.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>During this process, students occasionally refresh the registration website by mistake. When this happens, the system immediately displays an error message and forces the user to log in again. While this might be a measure to prevent the use of macros (though this remains unconfirmed), it poses a significant problem, since logging in again during such a high-pressure moment wastes precious time.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>To address this issue, I developed a browser extension that allows users to bypass the error message with a single click, eliminating the need for a full log-in. This extension is compatible with both <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snu-crs-refresher/hhdokgcmhmpckjdhekdjpoaafoggaaan'>Chrome</a> and <a href='https://store.whale.naver.com/detail/dkhijlinmdhldgjbbpmmelahpbnhmpcc'>Whale</a> browsers.</p>

  #     <p>Have you ever wished a robot to send romantic messages to the other on
  #     behalf of yourself? Having a conversation in a romantic relationship is
  #     often difficult. Sometimes we ask our friends for help, but such help is
  #     limited.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>In this project, we assumed that an AI agent in chat settings became so
  #     smart that it perfectly analyzes the counterpart's emotion and suggests
  #     responses in a chat setting. Along with a prototype app LOVEGORITHM that
  #     helps such a romantic relationship, we designed and developed an LOVEGORITHM
  #     online user community that illustrates possible feedback and behaviors of
  #     users. Check out the link above!<br><br></p>

  #     <p>Due to the irreversible characteristics and disastrous effects of
  #     Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a precise diagnosis of the symptoms
  #     is extremely important. Yet, paper-based Amsler Grid, the most prevalent
  #     testing method, is highly limited in that it requires the indirect report of
  #     patients and quantitative reporting is difficult.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>In this project, I designed and developed a touch-based Amsler grid web
  #     app. As such, I aimed to support patients' exact report of their regions of
  #     symptoms.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>What made this project special to me is that, I made a LaTeX template for
  #     writing this paper! I found that my friends preparing for their thesis
  #     always felt it difficult to produce a thesis format, since our department
  #     only gave us a 'scanned' version of template, not a real document. Thus, I
  #     generated a template which can be found <a
  #     href='https://github.com/donghoon-io/SNUECE-BS-thesis'>here</a> (this
  #     template was built upon previous Ph.D. dissertation template under
  #     license)<br><br></p>

  #     <p>This study was conducted for my B.S. thesis, and later published in HCI

  #     <p>It is a prevalent behavior of having a chat with strangers in online
  #     settings where people can easily gather. Yet, people often find it difficult
  #     to initiate and maintain conversation due to the lack of information about
  #     strangers.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the
  #     use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an
  #     ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with
  #     personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the
  #     conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest
  #     between users.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and
  #     BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both
  #     conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors

  #     <p>According to a recent survey conducted by American Psychological
  #     Association [1], academic stress is cited as the number one stressor in
  #     students' daily life. This issue is specifically considered serious in South
  #     Korea, where half of Korean teenagers experienced a thought of suicidal and
  #     academic stress is reported as a top-ranked attribute to such phenomenon
  #     [2].<br><br></p>

  #     <p>This, however, cannot be solely dealt with reducing academic affair.
  #     Since such academic phenomenon is multi-faceted with lots of stakeholders
  #     involved (e.g., homeroom teacher, parents, and friends), we should not
  #     naïvely understand the issue. For example, high schools often focus on
  #     increasing the number of students entering so-called 'prestigious
  #     universities.' However, by solely focusing on the name of university rather
  #     than a major, this often undermines the agency of students' decision on
  #     their future career, and leading students to suffer from subsidious academic
  #     stresses as well as a stress on the study itself.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>Since the academic curriculum drastically changes over time and
  #     policy-makers and relatively older people cannot easily understand such a
  #     situation, we aimed to show how difficult it is for high school students to
  #     'survive' under such factors that often lead to academic stresses. By having
  #     users choose a choice in each crossroad of choices and differentiating the
  #     following storieline, we, though indirectly, let them feel how stressed high
  #     school students would be in the midst of a choice.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>In this project, we designed an application for supporting those who
  #     study abroad, but came back due to COVID-19. Since they often suffer from
  #     lack of sleep due to the time difference, we aimed to support them with
  #     managing their health, at the same time not undermining their classworks. In
  #     order to precisely understand their needs, we conducted extensive user
  #     interview sessions, YouTube v-logger observation study, diary study, and web
  #     survey.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>As a result, we designed '夜-planet', an application that supports

  #     <p>At the end of my sophomore year, I read one CHI paper by chance:
  #     <b>'Blocks4All: overcoming accessibility barriers to
  #         blocks programming for children with visual impairments.'</b> Written by Milne and her colleagues, this paper
  #         explores the methods of overcoming accessibility issues in existing block-based programming tools. I was super
  #         intrigued by how HCI researchers try to understand user groups and reflect design implications into an artifact.<br><br></p>
  #     <p>Surprisingly, at that moment my supervisor asked if I'm willing to lead a
  #     project for developing an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication)
  #     application.
  #         Definitely I said yes, because I found it really difficult to take part in any research project as an undergrad without any
  #         previous research experience then. From then, I spent almost every night developing an iOS app, while simultaneously conducting
  #         user studies, reading relevant papers, and even designing! Literally everything was new: from being funded for a research to getting an
  #         approval from IRB for the evaluation! Fortunately, at the moment when I finished my research, we were almost at the deadline
  #         of <b>CHI 2020</b> and submitted our work there, and got accepted with an <b>Honorable Mention Award</b>.<br><br></p>
  #     <p>To summarize our paper briefly, we tried not to restrict a stakeholder of
  #     AAC to only a child, but also viewed their caregivers
  #         very important in the process of child's communication. Based on this research context, we aimed to develop a system that helps them collaborate to
  #         drive the best strategies on child's communication. As a result, we developed <b>Talkingboogie, a mobile AAC system for children
  #         with developmental disabilities</b>.</p>

  #     <p>I believe that one's favourite set of music in a specific period
  #     represents own emotion at that period. To prove this, I listed all my
  #     favourite songs by each semester. Then, I analyzed the emotion of each song
  #     using <a href='https://cyanite.ai'>Cyanite</a>, and I visualized the results
  #     with <a href='https://d3js.org'>D3.js</a>.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>Well, I was super shocked by the result. For my depressing time, I used
  #     to listen to melancholic songs. For my highest period, my playlist was full
  #     of happy and energetic songs. Why don't you try with your own
  #     playlist?<br><br></p>

  #     <p>In this project, I aimed to provide examples of some 'controversial'

  #     <p>I've been working as an iOS developer in a local micro-mobility sharing
  #     startup for about 2 years. As working in a tech company, I got to know

  #     that understanding possible users is extremely important for the success of
  #     service and business.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>Thus, I decided to take 'Digital Ethnography' class, where students
  #     choose one topic they want to deal with and explore user groups to better

  #     understand the topic. With the topic of <b>understanding why users hesitate
  #     riding a sharing mobility device and discuss solutions using
  #     ethnography</b>,

  #     I ran a couple of observation and interview studies with college students
  #     (N=6).<br><br></p>

  #     <p>Even though I could run the user observation study neither for a long
  #     term nor with a large number (COVID-19),

  #     with qualitative methodologies in the real-world context.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>It was extremely difficult for me to keep track of the courses I've taken
  #     during the undergraduate study. I'm surprised that many other friends also
  #     fased similar problem.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>To make this process hassle-free, I made an iOS app called <b>ECE
  #     grad</b>. Using this application, undergrads in ECE department may easily
  #     track their previously taken courses. Plus, this also shows how many credits
  #     they should additionally take. Plus, this system automatically visualizes
  #     the history and show some cheer-up messages for inducing students to take
  #     courses and keep track of their course history.<br><br></p>

  #     <p>However, some of my friends suggested that it was a bit time-consuming to
  #     manually add courses into the system. Based on this feedback, in order to
  #     facilitate the process of entering their previous courses, I added a
  #     <b>crawling function</b> that automatically crawls the relevant data within

      Results of this research are being formed into the manuscript <i>"Size Dependent Properties of Miura-ori Structure"</i> (C.Baek, T.Tachi, J.Yang, and H.Yasuda).
      We plan to submit the paper to <i>Physical Review Letters</i> (PRL) in 2025.<br>
      Detailed figures are withheld due to ongoing journal submission, but private Zoom meetings are available to discuss results!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>While looking into the analytical formulations of the stiffness of Miura-ori in the previous research, I discovered a curious phenomenon: 
      for small sized Miura-ori, the stiffness graph looked like a direc-delta function. Although this was not in the scope of the previous research,
      I decided to investigate this phenomenon further as a separate research project.<br>
      In an infinite Miura-ori sheet, the structure exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio, leading to a monotonic change in its overall length during deformation.
      In contrast, a finite Miura-ori structure shows a strikingly different behavior: its effective Poisson's ratio transitions from positive to negative.
      At the configuration where this sign change occurs, boundary effects create a local minimum in the global length and induce a geometry-driven locking along one of the principal axes.
      This locking phenomenon is strongly size-dependent, demonstrating size-dependent programmability in origami metamaterials.</p>

      alt='Size dependent locking in Miura-ori structure'>
      <p style='text-align: center;'><b>Size dependent locking in Miura-ori structure</b></p>

      <p>The gifs below show the compression tests of two different initial configurations of Miura-Ori structures.
      The left figure starts from the near fully unfolded state, while the right figure starts from a partially folded state.
      Locking is observed in both cases as the structure approaches its minimum height.<br>

      alt='Compression from folded configuration'>

      <p style='text-align: center;'><b>Compression from folded configuration</b></p>

      <p>The above size-dependent locking was due to a local minimum of the effective length along one principal axis, when Poisson's ratio equals zero.
      Extending the analysis to three dimensions, I found locking along directions in which the Poisson-coupled responses cancel, independent of tessellation size.
      The size-dependent locking emerges as the special case aligned with the principal orthotropic axis.</p>

      <p>Mechanical metamaterials are architected materials formed from periodically repeated unit cells.
      In the limit of infinite periodicity, their response can be described by an effective continuum with well-defined bulk properties. 
      In this research, we investigated Miura-ori-derived metamaterials, and developed a general framework to derive their homogenized properties.
      We demonstrated a wide range of tunability in directional elastic moduli, which stems from the transformable nature of origami-based structures.
      The elastic moduli are derived analytically through the theorem of virtual work, which are then validated through finite element simulations. 
      We also derive the conditions of isotropy in 2D planar Miura-ori tessellation and 3D Stacked Miura-ori structures.</p>

      <p>Our team modeled the parasitic resistance and capacitance in GAAFET and FinFET transistors through analytical approximation.
      Through this, we validated that the overall AC performance of GAAFET is superior to FinFET.
      We also optimized the geometric parameters of GAAFET device using analytical models to reduce both parasitic resistance and capacitance, 
      minimizing the RC product and enhancing AC performance. This work was presented in the semiconductor solve-a-thon hosted by the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT),
      earning us the Ministerial Award and $4,000 from the Ministry of Education.

      <p>The robotic leg is based on a bistable waterbomb-base structure, which possesses two stable equilibria—a folded state and an extended state—separated by an unstable transition state corresponding to the fully unfolded configuration of the base.
      Although the extended state corresponds to a partially folded waterbomb base, it appears as the fully deployed posture of the leg.
      Using rigid-origami kinematics and loop-closure constraints developed by Prof. Tachi, I constructed a simulation that visualizes the snap-through motion between these states.</p>

      <p>To further characterize the mechanism, I modeled each crease as a linear torsional spring and computed the resulting energy landscape. In this model, the configuration with
      \( \rho_3=0 \) represents the fully unfolded transition state, while the endpoints of each energy curve correspond to the folded and extended stable states
      (\( \rho_3=0 \) represents the folding angle of the center crease and \( \kappa \) the torsional constant of the springs; for detailed explanation, please refer to the attached report).
      The high energy at \( \rho_3=0 \) confirms that this configuration is the energy maximum, demonstrating the bistable nature of the structure.</p>

      <p>I also fabricated the prototypes using 3D printing, and the kinematic transitions were experimentally validated in a thick-origami implementation.
      A locking behavior was observed when a force was applied to the end of the leg in its folded state, indicating the need for a more detailed force analysis.</p>

      <p>Failures at large inclination angles are primarily attributed to unintended out-of-plane flexing and twisting of the flexures, along with weak adhesion between the flexures and the 3D-printed parts.</p>

      <p>Although the Flasher structure enables compact folding of a two-dimensional surface, no prior work has harnessed its defining characteristic: the rotation of its center during folding.
      In this research, I exploited this previously overlooked property to develop a torsion-driven mechanism capable of folding and deploying the structure.

      <p>For the term project in undergraduate course 'Mechatronics', our team built a music stand that automatically 
      turns the music sheets.
      This music stand recognizes the performer's playing and matches it with the preloaded sheet music on the 
      device to decide the right moment to turn the page.<br><br></p>

      <p>Our team won the grand prize in the course and won $2,000!</p>

      <p>This was a competition in the undergraduate course 'Creative Engineering Design' where we had to build robots that move objects across a field full of obstacles to score points.
      We built two robots—one to collect the items and one to deploy a slope to reach the scoring areas.
      I suggested using two slope robots that fit in the starting area as one and split apart during the match, an idea that ended up winning the Creative Award.</p>

      RunToYou is Seoul National University's Student Automotive Racing Team. Until 2020, the team focused on building off-road vehicles for the BAJA SAE competition.
      I mastered fundamental fabrication skills such as welding (SMAW, TIG), grinding, and assembling complex mechanical systems while working on the BAJA team as an engineer from 2019 to 2020.</p>

      In 2021, I led the Formula Powertrain team to design and build the team's first Formula racecar's overall powertrain system from scratch.
      This involved designing the layout of the powertrain components, selecting appropriate parts, and ensuring that the system met performance and safety requirements.<br>      
      With no prior cars to reference, I learned that engineering depends on communication as much as technical reasoning.
      I often reached beyond my own expertise by exchanging ideas with teams at other universities,
      consulting machinists about manufacturability and cost, and learning to weigh their perspectives alongside our design goals.
      I also organized seminars on simulation and CAD software (slides attached) and created detailed assembly documentation so the team could work with a common understanding.
