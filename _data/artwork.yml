      <p>During my sophomore year, I took <i>Introduction to Design 1</i> in the SNU College of Fine Arts, Department of Design. 
      One of the projects was to design a book cover for a text of my choice, which happened to be my highschool physics textbook <b>Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics</b> by Raymond A. Serway. 
      The design draws inspiration from Michelangelo's <i>The Creation of Adam</i>. The hands of God and Adam are composed of mathematical symbols, expressing the idea that the world is built upon fundamental scientific principles.
      At the point where their hands nearly touch, the fingers are formed from Maxwell's equations, representing the foundational laws of electromagnetism.
      Their meeting sparks a burst of light, a nod to both the Big Bang and the biblical phrase, "Let there be light". 
      The radiating light has the form of the properties of electromagnetic waves, further tying the imagery to the physics theme. 
      Note, this artwork is intended as a conceptual and symbilic interpretation, and is not connected to my personal religious beliefs.</p>
