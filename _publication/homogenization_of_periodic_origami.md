abstract: "(Tentative) Anisotropic mechanical properties are central to achieving lightweight and efficient structural systems, yet in conventional materials and lattice-based metamaterials such anisotropy is fixed by fabrication. Origami-based metamaterials provide an alternative paradigm in which mechanical response arises from geometry and can be reversibly reconfigured. Here, we investigate the anisotropic behavior of Miura-Ori–based origami architectures under the rigid-origami assumption, where deformation is governed solely by rotational motion at creases. Through analytical homogenization and numerical analysis, we derive the effective mechanical properties of tessellated Miura-Ori sheets and identify intrinsic orthotropy dictated by geometric symmetry. Extending the framework to stacked and tubular Miura-Ori assemblies, we show that directional stiffness and Poisson’s ratios are controlled by a small set of geometric parameters. Remarkably, a single origami architecture can continuously transition between isotropic and highly anisotropic mechanical responses without changes in material composition or topology, highlighting origami geometry as a powerful platform for programmable mechanical anisotropy."
