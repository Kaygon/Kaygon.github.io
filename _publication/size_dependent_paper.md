abstract: "We show that the Miura-ori, a canonical origami metamaterial, exhibits a size-dependent mechanical response. For a small number of unit cells, a size-independent edge contribution introduces a local minimum in transverse width. At this configuration, the Poisson's ratio becomes zero and directional stiffness diverges, leading to a kinematic locking state distinct from contact-driven locking mechanisms. Extending the analysis to three dimensions, we find locking along all directions in which the Poisson-coupled lateral responses cancel, independent of tessellation size. The size-dependent locking emerges as the special case aligned with the principal orthotropic axis. Varying tessellation size thus enables precise control over both the onset and the direction of locking in origami metamaterials."
