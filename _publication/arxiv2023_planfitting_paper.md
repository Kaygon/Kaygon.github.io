abstract: "We show that the Miura-Ori, a canonical origami metamaterial, exhibits a tessellation-size-dependent mechanical response. For a small number of unit-cells, the structure develops a local minimum in transverse width and a corresponding stiffness divergence arising from competition between a size-proportional body term and a size-independent edge term. Extending to three dimensions, we find that while locking generally appears in oblique directions regardless of tessellation sizes, only the size-dependent mode aligns with a principal axis of orthotropy and remains tunable by tessellation number. Varying tessellation size thus enables precise control over both the onset and direction of locking in origami metamaterials."
